IMGCAT - a ridiculously simple single image viewer

USAGE: imgcat [-b] <filename>

OPTIONS:
	-b	set the background / root window image

Imgcat will display an image and scale any size image to a reasonable default size for viewing (hardcoded to 640x480 at present, but will be configurable soon).  Imgcat also sets the window's resource name string to "float" which can be used by many tiling window managers' rules to not tile the window.

Imgcat does not, and will not, view directories of images, nor slideshows, nor lists of files.  Imgcat simply 'cats' an image to the screen for viewing or to the root window for a background.
